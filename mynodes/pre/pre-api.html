API Access
Your API key can be found at the bottom of the node dashboard page for any of your nodes: â€‹
https://nodes.presearch.com
/api/nodes/status/:api_key
Node Status API
Return the current status of all your nodes as well as (optionally) aggregated data for those nodes.

Notes:
* The connected and disconnected parameters cannot both be set to "false".  In this case the default (connected only) will be used.

* Replace :api_key with your API key. For example: /api/nodes/status/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

api_key
string
Your personal Node API key (this can be found at the bottom of the node dashboard page for any of your nodes: https://nodes.presearch.org/dashboard
public_keys
string
A comma-separated list of node public keys.  If this parameter is specified, only those nodes will be returned.  This parameter overrides the connected, disconnected, and include_inactive parameters (ie: if the specified nodes are found they will be returned regardless of their current status).
start_date
string
UTC date/time in ANSI format (Y-m-d H:i) - Start of reporting period for any node activity and stats.
(Default: 24 hours before current time)
end_date
string
UTC date/time in ANSI format (Y-m-d H:i) - End of reporting period for any node activity and stats.
(Default: current time)
stats
boolean
true|false - Whether or not to include aggregated historical stats for the nodes returned. Dates to aggregate between are specified with the start_date and end_date parameters.
(Default: false)
connected
boolean
true|false - Currently connected nodes should be included in the returned list
(Default: true)
disconnected
boolean
true|false - Currently disconnected nodes should be included in the returned list
(Default: true)
include_inactive
boolean
true|false - whether to also include nodes that haven't been active during the specified timeframe set by start_date and end_date
(Default: false)
Nodes successfully retrieved

Notes:
* All dates are returned in Zulu format (UTC)
* Each entry in the nodes object is keyed with the public key of that node
* The period object within each node object is only included if the stats=true parameter is passed
* Fields with unavailable data are returned as null
Request contains a missing or incorrect API key
You have exceeded the rate limits for the specified node(s) or API key
API Request Rate Limits:
The node status API enforces the following request rate limits PER NODE to ensure reasonable use of the API by node operators:
Requests without stats (default, stats=false): Up to 4 requests per minute
Requests with stats (stats=true): Up to 4 requests per hour
If you request status for any node more frequently than this your API will be temporarily blocked.
